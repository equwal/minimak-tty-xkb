Keyboard layouts for Minimak 4, 8 and 12 on Linux

See minimak.org for details.

TTYs (with .map files) and graphical X keymaps (with .xkb) are supported.

```sh
# In a TTY
$ sudo loadkeys minimak12.map
# In an X session
$ xkbcomp minimak12.xkb $DISPLAY
```
Also a good idea to put these commands in /etc/profile and ~/.xinitrc
for setting at startup.

Some extra layouts set Caps Lock to ESC, swap [] with (), rctrl as a "compose key", and flip punctuation and numbers.


These are the supported layouts as of v1.0, feel free to submit truex ate equwal doot com.

XKB layouts:                | 4 | 8 | 12|
default                     | v | v | v |
paren-swap                  | v | v | v |

paren-swap&flip&esc&compose | x | x | v |

map layouts:        | 4 | 8 | 12|
default             | v | v | v |

flipping            | x | x | x |
